## How Web Workers Work

Web Workers allow you to run JavaScript in background threads. They can perform tasks without interfering with the user interface. This is especially useful for tasks that are computationally expensive or need to run asynchronously.

### Web Worker Architecture

```mermaid
graph TD;
    A[Main Thread] -->|On Message| B[Web Worker]
    B -->|Post Message| A
    A -->|Render| C[Canvas]
    B -->|Game Logic| D[Game State]
```

### How It Works

1. **Main Thread**: Handles rendering and user input.
2. **Web Worker**: Processes game logic and state management.
3. **Communication**: Main thread and worker communicate via `postMessage` and `onmessage`.
4. **Rendering**: Main thread updates the canvas based on the game state.

### Example Code

#### Main Thread

```typescript
const worker = new Worker('worker.js');

worker.onmessage = (e) => {
    const { gameState } = e.data;
    // Update the game state and render
};

worker.postMessage({ task: 'START' });
```

#### Web Worker

```typescript
self.onmessage = (e) => {
    const { task } = e.data;
    if (task === 'START') {
        // Initialize game state
        postMessage({ gameState });
    }
};
```

## Game Features

1. **Terrain System**
   - Different terrain types with unique properties
   - Collision detection
   - Movement cost calculations

2. **Animation System**
   - Cloud generation and movement
   - Water wave effects
   - River flow animations
   - Character animations

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Web Worker offloading
   - Frame rate management
   - Idle state handling
   - Memory monitoring

4. **Debug Tools**
   - FPS counter
   - Memory usage
   - Game state viewer
   - Animation controls

## Controls

- Arrow keys or WASD for movement
- Toggle panels:
  - Debug information
  - Terrain legend
  - Animation settings

## Development

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
bun install
```

2. Start development server:
```bash
bun run dev
```

3. Build for production:
```bash
bun run build
```

## Architecture

The game uses a multi-threaded architecture:

- Main Thread: Handles rendering and user input
- Web Worker: Processes game logic and state management
- RAF Loop: Manages animations and frame timing
- Event System: Coordinates state updates

## Performance Considerations

- Web Worker offloads computation
- Frame throttling based on idle state
- Efficient canvas rendering
- Memory usage optimization
- Animation frame management
